## Practice (1)
Given two networks, network 1 and 2 
# 1. Calculate the number of nodes and edges.
2. Determine if the network is simple or not.
   a. If not simple, list all the self-loops and multi-edges.
3. List all the neighbors of node e and c in the network 1 and 2 respectively.
   a. If not simple, the duplicated neighbors and self-neighbors must be listed.
4. Design a function to check if the inputted two nodes are adjacent.
